    <string name="descripcionresena">In 1991, during the presidency of César Gaviria, the waters of the dam decreased. There was energy rationing. From the nearby hills it was possible to see a part of the ruins that stood out from the mud and puddles.
         The people of Peñol were able to see the territory where their home once stood.
This old generation keeps its history alive. They try to ensure that tourists not only visit the area to walk on the weekend and that the past does not drown alongside the ruins of their homes..</string>
